# GitHub Copilot for Eclipse

GitHub Copilot for Eclipse brings AI-assisted coding to the Eclipse IDE with these core capabilities:

- **Code completions** for in-editor suggestions from code context or natural-language comments.
- **Next Edit Suggestions** provide context-aware suggestions for your next code edits.
- **Agent Mode** for conversational help and more autonomous, project-aware assistance.
- **Model Context Protocol (MCP)** integration to connect Copilot with external tools and services.
- **Advanced Agentic Capabilities** include Custom Agents, Isolated Subagents, and Plan Agent, with more agentic capabilities coming soon.

## Usage-based billing support

Starting from version **0.18.0**, we have added internal support for the upcoming [usage-based billing experience](https://github.blog/news-insights/company-news/github-copilot-is-moving-to-usage-based-billing/), including experience updates to the usage panel, usage notifications, and model picker. These changes will become visible once usage-based billing is rolled out.

To ensure compatibility with the new billing experience, we strongly recommend upgrading the plugin to **0.18.0 or later** as soon as possible.

Clients using older plugin versions will continue to function. However, the billing and usage experience may not be optimal and may not accurately reflect the latest usage-based billing experience.

## Core capabilities

### Code completions

Inline suggestions (ghost text) appear as you type in the editor. Suggestions can range from small edits to multi-line changes.

### Next Edit Suggestions

Next Edit Suggestions predict your next edit location and propose the next change based on your recent edits and context.

### Agent and Ask Mode

**Ask Mode** provides conversational AI assistance for explaining code, generating code from requirements, suggesting refactors, and providing debugging guidance.

**Agent Mode** works autonomously across your project context to identify and fix issues, propose implementation steps, and support larger coding tasks with iterative guidance.

### Model Context Protocol (MCP)

MCP support enables integrating external tools and services into Copilot workflows where configured.

### Advanced Agentic Capabilities

- **Custom Agents** allow users to create personalized agents with specific instructions and behaviors.
- **Isolated Subagents** can be spawned by the main agent to handle specific tasks or contexts independently.
- **Plan Agent** can generate multi-step plans to accomplish complex tasks, breaking them down into manageable actions.
- **Skills** are reusable, specialized AI assistant templates that enrich chat context in Agent Mode. Skills are defined as `SKILL.md` files and can be scoped to a workspace or shared globally.

  - Creating Skills

    Place a `SKILL.md` file in any of these directories:

    - **Project-scoped:** `.github/skills/<skill-name>/`, `.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`, `.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`
    - **User-scoped (global):** `~/.copilot/skills/<skill-name>/`, `~/.claude/skills/<skill-name>/`, `~/.agents/skills/<skill-name>/`

    Each `SKILL.md` file can include YAML front matter with metadata (name, description) followed by Markdown content that provides domain knowledge, workflows, or instructions for the AI assistant.

    Skills are automatically discovered and available in Agent Mode. You can enable or disable skills in **Window → Preferences → Copilot → Chat → Enable Skills**.
